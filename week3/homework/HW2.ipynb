    "## Problem 2: Number Guessing Game with Hints (40pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will build a simple number guessing game using Python control structures. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100 and prompt the user to guess it. The game will continue until the user guesses the correct number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time the user makes a guess, the program should:\n",
    "1. Tell the user if their guess is **too high** or **too low**.\n",
    "2. Keep track of the number of guesses.\n",
    "3. End the game when the user guesses the correct number, displaying the total number of attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "- Understand and implement loops (`while` loops).\n",
    "- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making.\n",
    "- Work with user input and convert data types.\n",
    "- Utilize the `random` module for generating random numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Requirements**\n",
    "1. The entire game is implemented in a function. Once defined, you can play the game by calling this function. (5 pt)\n",
    "2. Generate a random number between 1 and 100. (Hint: can you do a web search and see how this can be achieved?) (5 pt)\n",
    "3. Prompt the user to enter their guess. (Use python built-in function input to allow users to enter their guesses) (5 pt)\n",
    "4. Use a loop to repeatedly check the user's guess. (which type of loop would you implement?) (5 pt)\n",
    "5. Provide hints (too high, too low) until they guess correctly. (5 pt)\n",
    "6. Keep track of the number of attempts. When the correct number is found, print out how many guesses the user made. (5 pt) \n",
    "7. Display a success message when the user guesses correctly. (5 pt)\n",
    "8. Use try-except structure to report error of incorret user input (e.g., the user did not enter an integer) (5 pt)\n"

    "2. **Do not use the `string` module.** Instead, manually check for:\n",
    "   - Letters (`'a' <= char <= 'z'` or `'A' <= char <= 'Z'`).\n",
    "   - Digits (`'0' <= char <= '9'`).\n",
    "   - Special characters (`!@#$%^&*()-+`).\n",
    "3. Prompt the user to enter a password. (print out a message to ask a user to enter their password) (5 pt)\n",
    "4. Call the function to evaluate the password. \n",
    "5. Print the password strength classification. \n",
    "6. Test your function on these passwards: thisisaverylongpassword, 4sA%, P@ssword1234 (you must test all three passwords to receive credit for this problem. )\n"
