Students should particularly be able to clearly and efficiently comment and document code. Students should also be able to communicate and collaborate effectively using state-of-the-art information technologies and appropriate presentational technologies (e.g., Camtasia, PowerPoint).\n1. **Tools:** Students should be able to identify and apply appropriate Python libraries and programming techniques to manipulate data, approximate solutions to equations, implement algorithms for simulation, visualize results, and perform other tasks useful to physicists.\n1. **Problem-solving:** Students should be able to adaptively identify and apply appropriate mathematical and computational tools and techniques to solve physical problems, model physical systems, and process data from simulations or experiments.\n1. **Making connections:** Students should be able to use and relate new concepts and techniques with concepts and techniques developed in earlier courses.\n1. **Intellectual maturity and metacognition:** Students should take responsibility for their own learning, for example by identifying areas in which they need additional practice in the course and taking steps to obtain necessary help.\n1. **Resourcefulness:** Students should be able to use technology to locate, access, evaluate, and use information, and appropriately cite resources from digital/electronic media.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction to Unix (Outline)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Commentary on usefulness of command line\n* scripts!\n* simple user interface\n* quick editing\n* remote access and navigation\n* file permissions\n\nYou will learn and practice basic command line tools in the first workshop","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[some quick demonstrations]","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Let's learn some python!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## To start: A graphing teaser","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\nprint(sys.version)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The material here is adapted from Chapter 0 in Eric Ayar's *Computational Physics With Python*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Hello world\")  # comment me here, limited in what I can write here\nprint(\"Hello again\")\n\nx = 5\ny = x * 5\nprint(y)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Those of you who know (La)TeX should be able to typeset *math formulae* and equations in the `Markdown` fields.
